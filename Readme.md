## Who I Am

I co-founded **Inclusive Brains** in 2022 alongside Olivier Oullier. Together, we build non-invasive, multimodal neurotechnologies powered by generative AI, enabling individuals with severe physical impairments to interact with digital environments through brainwaves and physiological signals

At **Wavestone**, I serve as Senior AI Applied Engineer Lead, leading MVP developpment (AI Agents and MCPs) for CAC40 Clients. Tech stack : Azure, GCP & On-prem solutions. Langchain / Google Agent Development Kit / Mistral AI Studio & Mistral Workflow.
